Saving a feeding will trigger a second form, where the feeding type (e.g., solid food) and

## Other timers

![](screenshots/help_timers_default.png)

In a previous version of Babybuddy for Android, the app listed an arbitrary
number of timers. Now, by default, only timers for the events that can be tracked
by the app are visible. This was changed to achieve compatibility with
Baby Buddy version 2.0.
