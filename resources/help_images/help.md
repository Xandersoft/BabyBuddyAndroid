After logging in, the first thing you should do is setup the timers that you want to use.
Typically, you can click "Create Default Timers" to create timers for some primary activities

If you started the app while timers were already running in your Baby Buddy app, this button
is not available. Instead, the pre-existing timers will appear on screen.
You can overwrite the current timers and (re-)create the default timers via the
"Recreate Default Timers" option from the menu.

## Configuring Timers
